# software-webservices-go

Example project from a course recreated to the best of my ablities in Golang. Using other supporting modules to help learn a new ecosystem to accomplish a functional equivalent to the other project. Since I do not have a WSDL service created that I can use as a reference, I have decided to migrate that service to a gRPC implementation instead as it is close enough.
